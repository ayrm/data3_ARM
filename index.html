  <p> Every Monday and Tuesday, a small group of women log onto Google Meets for class. However, this class is unlike any online class we’re used to seeing. The women sit in their homes with fuzzy socks, homemade tea or coffee and their favorite loungewear ready to crochet and knit with what one participant described as “her best friends.”</p>

  <p> This class is provided by the Hunts Point branch of the New York Public Library while it’s under renovations. Before it closed for renovations, the Hunts Point Library was also closed as a result of the pandemic. For many, this library was a necessary access point for internet services and classes. Despite these hurdles, Hunts Point has found a few ways to stay connected. </p>

  <p> One way they’ve been able to stay connected is thanks to the <a href="https://www.huntspoint.nyc/hunts-point-free-wifi">Hunts Point Community Network Project</a>. Founded in 2017, the program was designed to be an emergency network for Hunts Point residents. In Hunts Point, 23% of residents and 13% of children do not have access to the internet according to the <a href="https://data.cccnewyork.org/data/table/1325/household-internet-access#1325/1547/62/a/a">US census</a>.</p>

  <p> Additionally, <a href="https://data.cccnewyork.org/data/table/1325/household-internet-access#1326/1549/62/a/a">38%</a> of Hunts Point residents who make less than $20,000 annually, which is almost <a href="https://furmancenter.org/neighborhoods/view/hunts-point-longwood">43%</a> of residents, do not have internet access. As of 2019, over 3,000 households in Hunts Point who make less than $20,000 had no broadband access; much more than other commuity districts across the city.<!p>

  </script>

  <p> Luis Saula, manager of the network project, said that the program’s true test came during the pandemic. </p>

  <p> Saula said that the need for internet access is as necessary as needing water. “Now, the internet isn’t just for entertainment. People rely on the internet to make a living and to get an education. There are people in our neighborhood that don’t have the resources to pay for an internet provider, so we have to be creative on how to solve these problems.” </p>

  <p> The way the program works is by placing “nodes,” or internet access points, in small businesses where most people frequent, or ones that are closer to residential areas </p>

  <p> “Especially with the weather getting colder, people have to find places to work. If they choose to go to a business, we can guarantee internet access. If they stay home, we try to put nodes near them so that they can still work from their apartments,” said Saula. </p>

  <p> The internet access is free for all Hunts Point residents. </p>

  <p> Those that used to rely on the Hunts Point Library now rely on this network to run their programs and classes. </p>

  <p> The crochet and knitting instructor, Caroline Magee, said that the internet access allowed her to stay in contact with her students and friends, some of whom now live in another borough and states. </p>

  <p> “It allows me to do what I love with the people I love. With our busy schedules, there’s no way to guarantee I’ll have time for these social classes if they were in person,” said Magee. “The pandemic forced us to stay home, but now we’re realizing new options to stay connected." </p>

  <p> Saula said the pandemic proved exactly how necessary it is to have internet access for all. </p>

  <p> “Nothing is impossible if you can imagine. It can be difficult, but never impossible. This pandemic has proven the need for internet access in Hunts Point." </p>

  <p> The Hunts Point Community Network Program currently provides connection to about 40% of the neighborhood, but hopes to connect the entire community in the future. </p>
